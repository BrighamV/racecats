                    <h3>What's the goal of Race Cats Elite Track?</h3><br/><br/>
                    To prepare kids for high school competition in track and field events through teaching proper technique,
                    a healthy competitive mindset, and confidence.<br/><br/>
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3><br/><br/>
                    We provide multiple stations at each practice. Athletes will rotate to the different stations. We would like
                    to encourage athletes to try ALL of the events we offer. These athletes are young and you never know what you
                    could be good at until you give it a try. We hope to have most of these practices on a track, but with the
                    busy track schedules in the district, we will also have some practices at local parks! All practice days and
                    times will always stay updated in teamsnap! <br/><br/>

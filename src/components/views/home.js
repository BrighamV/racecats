                Race Cats is excited to announce that registration for Track 2022 is OPEN!  We love giving kids the opportunity
                to exercise, improve their skills, enjoy the outdoors and make friends. For our Junior High and Track-loving
                elementary kids, we have a competition team where all kids who turn 8 by 12/31/2022 and older, regardless of 
                ability, will be able to compete in multiple meets and train for all track events and on actual tracks (as 
                much as possible) with experienced coaches. We also have an option for elementary kids in Davis County who
                would like to practice on their own school fields or at local parks.  These teams will focus on the following 
                track events: 1600m run, 400m dash, 100m dash, softball throw, javelin, and long jump. FOR REGISTRATION AND 
                TEAM DETAILS VISIT THE TEAM PAGE (TEAMS BASED ON LOCATION) LISTED AT THE TOP OF OUR WEBSITE!

                    <h2>What is race cats?</h2>
                The Race Cats Cross Country Program runs from September through October.  It is designed to introduce kids of 
                all experience and ability to the empowering and life-enriching practice of long-distance running through a 
                positive experience that emphasizes FUN and rewards effort, attitude, and personal bests.<br/><br/>
                The Race Cats Track and Field Program begins the first part of April.  This program is designed to help all 
                kids learn several disciplines in Track AND Field.  They will learn to jump, throw and run and have several 
                opportunities to compete in these events.

                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                 For our elementary teams, practice is held twice a week on your child's school 
                field or at a nearby park for one hour. Children are praised for effort and improvement. Each team has their 
                own jersey color and comes to two races with other Race Cats teams in their city. In the Fall we will have a 
                third race, the Race Cats Championship, where all Race Cats teams come together and compete.<br/><br/>
                For our competition teams, we will have a longer season, more racing opportunities and experienced coaches 
                to help your athlete develop skills, have fun, and eventually be ready to compete at a high school level.
                For more information about the competition teams, please visit the page of the team you are interested in!

                    <h2>Coaching opportunities</h2>
                Coaches do not need 
                to be experienced runners or even parents at the school. Just willing adults who enjoy kids and who can 
                follow a lesson plan and encourage an energetic group of kids. We will provide coaches with a daily lesson
                plan, coaching kit with supplies for lesson activities, and a small stipend. <br/><br/>
                
                Coaches can also get one of their own children registered for free! If you are interested in leading a team 
                at your school, please contact the Race Cats Director for your city.<br/><br/>

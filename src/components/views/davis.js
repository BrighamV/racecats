                    <h3>What's the goal of Race Cats Elite Track?</h3><br/><br/>
                    To prepare kids for high school competition in track and field events through teaching proper technique,
                    a healthy competitive mindset, and confidence.<br/><br/>
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3><br/><br/>
                    We provide multiple stations at each practice. Athletes will rotate to the different stations. We would like
                    to encourage athletes to try ALL of the events we offer. These athletes are young and you never know what you
                    could be good at until you give it a try. We hope to have most of these practices on a track, but with the
                    busy track schedules in the district, we will also have some practices at local parks! All practice days and
                    times will always stay updated in teamsnap!<br/><br/>

                    <h3>Jami Caldwell</h3>
                    "I started running in 8th grade. It started out as a social thing--my friends were doing it. At my first
                     race, I got last place! That didn't sit well with me and I kept at it and was running varsity at the high
                      school by 9th grade. I then went on to run at BYU and was a member of 2 National Champion Cross Country
                       teams. I've run competitively ever since (in between babies and injuries).<br/><br/>
                    I love running because no matter what your ability level is, you can always improve and there is a place
                     for EVERYBODY. Everyone on a team contributes in their own way. Running is a great way to learn the values
                      of hard work, persistence, teamwork, and having fun.<br/><br/>
                    I have been on many teams where there is a lot of positive energy (synergy!) and I'm excited to bring that
                     to Race Cats! I believe that I was blessed with a few of the BEST coaches in the nation. Both in High School
                      (Roger Buhrley) and in college (Patrick Shane). I'm really looking forward to paying it forward with these
                       awesome kids in Davis County."

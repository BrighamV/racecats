                    <h2>What is race cats?</h2>
                The Race Cats Cross Country Program runs from September through October.  It is designed to introduce kids of 
                all experience and ability to the empowering and life-enriching practice of long-distance running through a 
                positive experience that emphasizes FUN and rewards effort, attitude, and personal bests.<br/><br/>
                The Race Cats Track and Field Program begins the first part of April.  This program is designed to help all 
                kids learn several disciplines in Track AND Field.  They will learn to jump, throw and run and have several 
                opportunities to compete in these events.

                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                 For our elementary teams, practice is held twice a week on your child's school 
                field or at a nearby park for one hour. Children are praised for effort and improvement. Each team has their 
                own jersey color and comes to two races with other Race Cats teams in their city. In the Fall we will have a 
                third race, the Race Cats Championship, where all Race Cats teams come together and compete.<br/><br/>
                For our competition teams, we will have a longer season, more racing opportunities and experienced coaches 
                to help your athlete develop skills, have fun, and eventually be ready to compete at a high school level.
                For more information about the competition teams, please visit the page of the team you are interested in!

                    "I started running in 8th grade. It started out as a social thing--my friends were doing it. At my first
                     race, I got last place! That didn't sit well with me and I kept at it and was running varsity at the high
                      school by 9th grade. I then went on to run at BYU and was a member of 2 National Champion Cross Country
                       teams. I've run competitively ever since (in between babies and injuries).<br/><br/>
                    I love running because no matter what your ability level is, you can always improve and there is a place
                     for EVERYBODY. Everyone on a team contributes in their own way. Running is a great way to learn the values
                      of hard work, persistence, teamwork, and having fun.<br/><br/>
                    I have been on many teams where there is a lot of positive energy (synergy!) and I'm excited to bring that
                     to Race Cats! I believe that I was blessed with a few of the BEST coaches in the nation. Both in High School
                      (Roger Buhrley) and in college (Patrick Shane). I'm really looking forward to paying it forward with these
                       awesome kids in Davis County."
